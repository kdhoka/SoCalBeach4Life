# SoCalBeach4Life
“SoCalBeach4Life” is developed driven by the enthusiasm of southern California residents to the beaches near their neighborhood. Locals love to visit beaches for family and friend-gathering purposes. To make plans for beach visits, people need an app to provide information on estimated travel time to each beach, nearby restaurants, and travel routes and parking lots options.

An android app that allows users to:
- Register and login
- Input, view and change user profiles
- Get information on nearby beaches in the SoCal Area
- Find nearby restaurants and parking lots to beaches
- Find best routes to beaches
- Read and write reviews for beaches
